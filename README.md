# Introduction
- With the rapid increase in computing speed, mankind has been able to organize and analyze large amounts of data that have never been experienced before at incredibly high speed.
- Based on that, it is possible for computers to be learned and be developed to the current status of artificial intelligence.
- Even if you do not become a software engineer, you can solve many practical problems that you may see in the real world through the data processing skills you have learned so far using Python and especially Pandas.
- Pandas, a core library of data analysis applied in various fields, was originally developed to analyze and organize financial data.
- The core of data analysis is financial data analysis. Through the practice of acquiring and processing financial data of various factors accumulated over a period of time, you can be sufficiently prepared for most data types that you will see in real-world work.
- Financial data analysis is the most effective practice in data analysis.

# Objective
- Now, let's use all the skills we have learned so far to solve the following tasks: 
  - Obtaining financial data from remote data repositories
  - Visualizing stock price data based on time series data
  - Visualizing trading volume data based on time series data
  - Measuring simple daily rate
  - Calculating simple daily cumulative rate of return
  - Calculating the rate of return by moving the period by month
  - Calculating moving average
  - Analyzing the correlation between each financial data factor Calculating stock price volatility


# Overview
- The data material used for data analysis is stock data that track various sectors and economic conditions. It is not simply analyzing the stock price of a specific company. It was chosen because there is no better target data to understand each economic situation as a real economy. In addition, the target data is not for companies, raw materials, bonds, or in a specific country, but for the price of agricultural products around the world.
- Since the US market has a very large impact on the real economy of the world, it was selected as a good practice with meaningful data.

- Ticker name:
  - SPY, which tracks the leading US index S&P 500
  - IYW, which tracks U.S. technology company market capitalization index
  - VT, which invests in companies around the world
  - DBA, which tracks the supply and demand of agricultural products and prices
  - US Bond Rate TLT
  - PDBC, which tracks the supply and demand of other raw materials and prices
  - Gold IAU
