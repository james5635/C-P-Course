Financial Data Analysis Mini Project
I The data material used for data analysis is stock data that track various sectors and economic conditions. It is not simply analyzing the stock price of a specific company. It was chosen because there is no better target data to understand each economic situation as a real economy. In addition, the target data is not for companies, raw materials, bonds, or in a specific country, but for the price of agricultural products around the world.
I Since the US market has a very large impact on the real economy of the world, it was selected as a good practice with meaningful data.
